	journal = {Journal of Physics E: Scientific Instruments},
	abstract = {The fundamentals of ion motion in electromagnetic fields are reviewed in detail with a special emphasis on electric radio-frequency (RF) fields which are used frequently in dynamic mass spectrometry. Forces and effects on ions in electromagnetic fields which are typically neglected, but which may be important in practical applications are reviewed and discussed for completeness. A method, based on complex variable theory, is developed for finding the potential function of 'ideal multipole electromagnetic fields'. Application of this method for the determination of potential functions and differential equations of ion motion is demonstrated with reference to the electric radio-frequency dipole, quadrupole, hexapole, octupole and decapole fields. This is the first time that these topics have been addressed in one unified and fundamental literature presentation. The results and implications of this preliminary communication and tutorial are of importance in ion physics and dynamic mass spectrometry.}

abstract = {We describe the operation of an electrodynamic ion trap in which the electric quadrupole field oscillates at two frequencies. This mode of operation allows simultaneous tight confinement of ions with extremely different charge-to-mass ratios, e.g., singly ionised atomic ions together with multiply charged nanoparticles. We derive the stability conditions for two-frequency operation from asymptotic properties of the solutions of the Mathieu equation and give a general treatment of the effect of damping on parametric resonances. Two-frequency operation is effective when the two speciesâ€™ mass ratios and charge ratios are sufficiently large, and further when the frequencies required to optimally trap each species are widely separated. This system resembles two coincident Paul traps, each operating close to a frequency optimised for one of the species, such that both species are tightly confined. This method of operation provides an advantage over single-frequency Paul traps, in which the more weakly confined species forms a sheath around a central core of tightly confined ions. We verify these ideas using numerical simulations and by measuring the parametric heating induced in experiments by the additional driving frequency.}
