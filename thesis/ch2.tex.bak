\chapter{Aplying theory}
\label{chap:math}

After the reader gained sufficient knowledge to understand your problem in \cref{chap:refs}, you can jump to your own advanced material and conclusions.

You will need definitions (see \cref{defn:x} below in \cref{sec:demo}), theorems (\cref{thm:y}), general mathematics, algorithms (\cref{alg:w}), and tables (\cref{tab:z})\todo{See documentation of package \texttt{booktabs} for hints on typesetting tables. As a main rule, \emph{never} draw a vertical line.}. \Cref{fig:f,fig:g} show how to make a nice figure. See \cref{fig:schema} for an example of TikZ-based diagram. Cross-referencing helps a lot to keep the necessary parts of the narrative close --- use references to the previous chapter with theory wherever it seems that the reader could have forgotten the required context.
