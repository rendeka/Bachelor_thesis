\chapwithtoc{Introduction}

The practical aim of this thesis is to contribute to the development of an experiment initiated by my supervisor Mgr. Michal Hejduk, Ph.D. In this experiment, we wish to create and study the properties of a quite unusual type of plasma, Coulomb crystal. Coulomb crystals are mostly stationary structures of ions characterized by large coupling parameter $\Gamma$, representing the ratio between electrostatic and kinetic energy of ions. These structures have been extensively studied now for decades. Our ambition is to introduce electrons to such a crystal, which to my knowledge, hasn't been achieved yet. We will be aiming for sub-kelvin temperatures when electrons de Broglie wavelength would be bigger than the distance between them, forming so-called Fermi gas. Creating a Coulomb crystal means confining a certain number of charged particles in bounded space. The first thing standing in our way is the Earnshaw theorem, stating that there is no stable electrostatic configuration of charged particles. Of course, we are not about to give up just yet. Therefore we must try our luck outside the realm of electrostatics. Here we have already been presented with two well-established ways of storing charged particles. One utilizes an axial magnetic field to confine particles in a radial direction, and a rapidly changing electric field for confinement in an axial direction. This approach developed by H.G. Dehmelt is called the Penning trap. The second option to restrict the movement of charged particles in all directions is to use the dynamic electric field solely. Such a trap bears the name of Wolfgang Paul, hence the Paul trap. Both these gentlemen were, for their efforts in this field, awarded a shared Nobel prize for physics in 1989. The ions in our experiment will be laser-cooled, which would be disturbed by a magnetic field due to Zeeman splitting. Ergo we are left with the latter method. My job will be to make a computer simulation of an ion crystal with electrons inside a Paul trap trying to optimize the parameters of the trap to attain the lowest possible temperature of electrons, hopefully reaching the point of crystalization for such a system.
