\section{Two frequency quadrupole Paul trap}
\label{sec:two frequency trap}
\xxx{\dots build a little bridge from the section explaining a single frequency trap. We need two frequencies for particles with widely different charge to mass ratios: $Q_m \equiv \nicefrac{Q}{m}$ \cite{FOOT2018117}.}
In the case of a linear quadrupole with perfectly hyperbolical electrodes with cylindrical symmetry we have a electric potential in the form \cite{leefer2017investigation}
:

\begin{equation}
	V(t, \vb{r}) = \bigg[ V_0 + V_1 cos(\Omega_1 t) + V_2 \cos(\Omega_2 t) \bigg] \frac{x^2 + y^2 - 2 z^2 }{2 \ell_0^2},
\end{equation}
where $V_0$ is an amplitude of static potential, $V_1$ of slower potential and $V_2$ is an amplitude of rapidly oscillating potential on the electrode. The equations of motion for a particle in such potential, after change of variable: $\tau = \nicefrac{t}{(2 \Omega_1)}$ are:

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	\ddot{x}(\tau) & = x(\tau) \bigg[ a - 2 q_1 \cos\left(2\frac{\Omega_1}{\Omega_2} \tau \right) - 2 q_2 \cos(2\tau) \bigg], \\
	\ddot{y}(\tau) & = y(\tau) \bigg[ a - 2 q_1 \cos\left(2\frac{\Omega_1}{\Omega_2} \tau \right) - 2 q_2 \cos(2\tau) \bigg], \\
	\label{studied eq of motion}
	\ddot{z}(\tau) & = -2z(\tau) \bigg[ a - 2 q_1 \cos\left(2\frac{\Omega_1}{\Omega_2} \tau \right) - 2 q_2 \cos(2\tau) \bigg],
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $a$, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are dimensionless parameters:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	a & = 4 Q_m \dfrac{V_0}{\Omega_2^2 \ell_0^2}, \\
	q_1 & = -2 Q_m \dfrac{V_1}{\Omega_2^2 \ell_0^2}, \\
	q_2 & = -2 Q_m \dfrac{V_2}{\Omega_2^2 \ell_0^2}.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\section{Floquet theory}
\label{sec:floquet}

Since the particle experiences the weakest confinement in the z-direction, we will examine this equation's properties. Floquet theory is a theory covering linear first-order ODEs with periodic coefficients. These are equations of the form:
\begin{equation}
	\label{Floquet structure}
	\dot{\vb{u}}(\tau) = \tensorq{F}(\tau) \vb{u}(\tau),
\end{equation}
where $\tensorq{F}$ is a matrix valued function with minimal period $T$. Let's illustrate this theory for the case of our differential equation. We begin by rewriting the equation \eqref{studied eq of motion} as a system of two first-order differential equations written in the matrix form:
\begin{align}
\label{matrix mathieu}
	\frac{d}{d \tau}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		z(\tau) \\
		\dot{z}(\tau)
	\end{bmatrix}	
	&=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		0 & 1 \\
		-2\bigg( a - 2 q_1 \cos\left(2\dfrac{\Omega_1}{\Omega_2} \tau \right) - 2 q_2 \cos(2\tau) \bigg) & 0	
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		z(\tau) \\
		\dot{z}(\tau)
	\end{bmatrix},
\end{align}
which already has a structure of \eqref{Floquet structure}. Without the necessity of finding a solution to this system, we can acquire knowledge about its stability. The information we are interested in is whether a solution is bounded for a given set of parameters or not. In this section, we will limit ourselves to the driving frequencies, which can be represented as: $\nicefrac{\Omega_2}{\Omega_1} \equiv \nicefrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers and $\nicefrac{m}{n}$ is an irreducible fraction. Then the matrix in equation \eqref{matrix mathieu} is $T = m \pi$ periodic. As in \cite{leefer2017investigation}, we identify the edge of stability regions as a set of parameters for which a solution of \eqref{studied eq of motion} is a $2T$ periodic function\footnote{Note that such stability condition differs from the one we demand while simulating the motion of a particle. The periodic solution of equation of motion implies boundedness, but the value of this boundary might lie outside the physical dimensions of the trap. That is why we ought not to be surprised when we find some differences in stability diagrams, even for the simplest case of a single particle in the trap. \label{foot: different stability condition}} to our problem \eqref{matrix mathieu}. This allows us to seek a solution to our problem in the form:
\begin{equation}
	\label{Floquet ansatz}
	z(\tau) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_k \exp(i\frac{k}{m}\tau),
\end{equation}
where $c_k$ are constant coefficients. Substituting this into equation \eqref{matrix mathieu} yields an identity:

\begin{multline}
	\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}\left[ \left(a - \dfrac{k^2}{m^2} \right)c_k - q_1 \left(c_{k-2n} + c_{k+2n} \right) - q_2 \left(c_{k-2m} + c_{k+2m} \right)  \right] \\ \exp(i\frac{k}{m}\tau) = 0,
\end{multline}
which holds for every $\tau$ only if each element of the sum is equal to zero. This relation can be written as:

\begin{equation}
	\label{Floquet edge eq}
	\tensorq{F} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
	\vdots \\
	c_{k-1} \\
	c_{k} \\
	c_{k+1} \\
	\vdots
	\end{bmatrix} = \vb{0},
\end{equation}
where $\tensorq{F}$ is an infinite matrix with elements:

\begin{equation}
	\tensorq{F}_{i j} = \left[ \left(a - \dfrac{k^2}{m^2} \right)\delta_{i j} - q_1 \left(\delta_{i j-2n} + \delta_{i j+2n} \right) - q_2 \left(\delta_{i j-2m} + \delta_{i j+2m} \right)  \right],
\end{equation} 
where:
\begin{equation}
	\delta_{ij} = 
	\begin{cases}
		1 & i=j, \\
		0 & i \neq j.
	\end{cases}	
\end{equation}
The equation \eqref{Floquet edge eq} is equivalent to:
\begin{equation}
	\label{Floquet determinant}
	det(\tensorq{F}) = 0.
\end{equation}
So the determination of stability boils down to computing a determinant of a matrix $\tensorq{F}$. We approximate $\tensorq{F}$ by sufficiently large $\rightarrow (10m+1) \times (10m+1)$ finite matrix. For the index $k$ in previous equations it means: $$k \in \{ -5m, \ -5m+1, \  \cdots, \ 5m-1, \ 5m \} \subset \Z,$$ neglecting solutions with smaller periods. Parameters for which $det(\tensorq{F}) > 0$ were identified as stable, otherwise unstable.
 	
\section{Simulation}
\label{sec:simulation}

\subsection{Choice of time-step}

We have tried several integration methods when numerically solving our equations of motion, whether with exact or effective potential.
Choice of time-step is always a delicate issue. For the case of solving the Mathieu-type equation, we followed the Nyquist criterion \xxx{\cite{1697831}}. Nyquist criterion is used mainly in signal processing for compact signals with convergent Fourier series. It states that for the signal with the highest frequency $f$, the largest possible sample size so that the discretization of the signal will carry equivalent information as the continuous one is $\nicefrac{1}{(2 \ f)}$. We started numerically solving the equation of motion with this time step, gradually increasing its size until the numerical solution with the denser sampling would give us the same result for the given tolerance. Repeating this process for several methods \footnote{All tried methods can be found in the file \textit{intMethods.py}} for numerical solving of ODEs \cite{teukolsky1992numerical}. For the case of a single electron in the trap with the expected initial conditions \textit{thisOne.dat} had the best performance a predictor-corrector method, which we have defined as \textit{StepEulerAdvanced}. The sufficient time-step for this method was $\Delta t = \nicefrac{1}{(5 \ f)}$. \todo{\textbackslash verb doesn't work for some reason that's why are names of the files are currently in italics}


\subsection{Treatment of laser cooling}
In our simulation, we treated the effect of laser cooling of ions by introducing a new frictional force, meaning it is proportional to $\propto - \vb{\dot{r}}$. The strength of this force is characterized by the parameter $\beta \in (0,1)$. 
Let us begin this section by summarizing our approximations (inspired by \cite{Friedman_1982}) when deriving the equation of motion. 

\subsection{Simulating Coulomb crystal}
We simulated Coulomb crystal by molecular dynamics, meaning we solved the equation of motion for each ion in effective potential with Coulomb interaction. 
We simulated the creation of a Coulomb crystal by molecular dynamics while keeping an eye on the total potential energy. We solved an equation of motion for each ion in effective potential with Coulomb interaction and laser cooling represented by the damping factor. We have used damping parameter $\beta$ large enough to decelerate the particles within a computationally reasonable time. To ensure that the ions had enough time to find a potential minimum, they were given a synthetic boost in kinetic energy every time they were slowed down to the minimal temperature, which can be obtained by laser cooling \xxx{(about \SI{0.01}{Kelvin})}. \todo{might be good idea to implement some simplex based algorithm with the molecular dynamics}
