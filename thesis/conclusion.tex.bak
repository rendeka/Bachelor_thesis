\xxx{We were perhaps able to optimize parameters of two frequency Paul trap for storing ions and electrons together\dots Next step will be applying obtained observations and updating the software to reproduce results of this thesis for the real geometry}


\xxx{In this thesis, we have presented a current state of knowledge about ion trapping in Paul traps and the newest development in the simultaneous trapping of electrons and ions\dots

We have derived optimal parameters of the two frequency trap\dots

We have shown\dots

This and this was performed and this and this will be extended in the future to assist in determination of optimal experimental conditions for studies of low energy ion-electron interactions. Namely this and this ha
